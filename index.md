**\>** Hi! I am Nathan, an engineer and researcher working at the edge of Machine Learning, Neurosciences and Language sciences, currently living in [Bordeaux, France](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/44.8364/-0.5703)!

**\>** After training as an Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive sciences engineer at [ENSC](https://www.bordeaux-inp.fr/en) in Bordeaux, France, I joined the Mnemosyne research group at [Inria](https://inria.fr/en) and the [Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases (IMN)](http://www.imn-bordeaux.org/en/), lead by [Frédéric Alexandre](https://www.labri.fr/perso/falexand/) and [Nicolas Rougier](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/). I worked under the supervision of [Xavier Hinaut](https://sites.google.com/site/xavierhinaut/) as an engineer and a doctoral student on trying to unfold the mechanisms behind language production and comprehension in the brain, and the interplay between speech perception and speech production. My tool of preference is Reservoir Computing, and I enjoy fiddling with different flavors of Recurrent Neural Networks and playing with the surprising properties of neural activity at the edge of chaos.

**\>** More generally, I am interested in computer science and software development (especially open source!) and had the chance to have free rein on building community-driven Python tools such as [reservoirpy](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy). I also love sharing what I know and have the pleasure of giving the amazing [Baptiste Pesquet](https://www.bpesquet.fr/) a hand with teaching Master I and II students about the dark arts of deep learning and timeseries analysis and forecasting.

**\>** You may find more information about me in my [resume](/resume) (also available as PDF bellow), alongside a list of my scientific publications and presentations in the [Publications](/publications) section. I also provide some teaching materials in the [Resources](/resources) section, and finally display some of my artworks (I spend a lot of my free time drawing, painting, and do some embroidery work) in the [Art](/art) section.
