# My "I want to teach Deep Learning" toolbox (acknowledgments) 

I made the courses I publish here myself, but of course
I built them based on the work of numerous other people.
The list of acknowledgment would be big, and I admit it was a bit
lost in the process, but here is a short list of some amazing
people and contents that helped me build (directly or without knowing it) 
these teaching materials:

\> Baptiste Pesquet and his [*magnum opus*](https://www.bpesquet.fr/teaching/), that I enjoyed as a student and now as a collaborator.

\> [Xavier Hinaut](https://sites.google.com/site/xavierhinaut/), who provided me with building blocks for some of my courses.

\> [Nicolas Rougier](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/) and his ultimate guides through [Matplotlib](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/scientific-visualization.html) and [reproducibility](https://rr-france.github.io/bookrr/) (the [Matplotlib 
cheatsheets](https://github.com/matplotlib/cheatsheets) saved my life so many times now).

\> Jason Brownlee and [his amazing website](https://machinelearningmastery.com/).

\> [Mantas Lukoševičius](https://mantas.info/), who helped me make sense of
Reservoir Computing with [his astonishingly simple guide](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/uploads/PracticalESN.pdf).

\> Christopher Olah and [his amazing blog](https://colah.github.io/) which I 
always show to students.

\> The great initiative of MIT OpenCourseWare, making MIT courses available to anyone.
I was particularly helped by the theoretical courses of [Peter Kempthorne on 
timeseries analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps).

\> Andrej Karpathy, who we do not present anymore. [Just clicked on everything he does here](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).


\> These [very nice Stanford Deep Learning cheatsheets.](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/)
